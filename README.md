Internet Enyclopedia | Paraphrasing Feature | Data Summary

The application called Krawler has been created to extract information from the internet, but it differs from Google in 
that it provides a condensed version of any query given to it. 
Nowadays, people prefer to have easy access to brief and precise information about events, individuals, or historical 
dates, rather than browsing multiple websites in search of a suitable definition or summary. 
Krawler fulfills this need by offering not only concise data but also the option to paraphrase it and save it to your 
computer. 
However, it should be noted that Krawler does not function as a dictionary but rather as an online encyclopedia.
Therefore, users should treat it as such and not use it as a search engine.
The source code isn't open source due to customer-client contracts.
